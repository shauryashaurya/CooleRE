# coolRE - Finite Automata / NFA-DFA.

A regular expressions engine written in Python.
This variant is built using finite automata (NFA-DFA) approach and (probably) [Thompson's Construction](http://xysun.github.io/posts/regex-parsing-thompsons-algorithm.html) aka [McNaughton–Yamada–Thompson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction).
