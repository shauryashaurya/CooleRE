# coolRE Regular Expressions Engine
coolRE (cooler) is a set of regular expression engines implemented from scratch in Python.

The goal is to implement 3 variants:
1. [A toy engine for learning](https://github.com/shauryashaurya/coolRE/tree/main/toy)
1. [One based on backtracking](https://github.com/shauryashaurya/coolRE/tree/main/backtracking)
1. [And lastly one based on Finite Automata](https://github.com/shauryashaurya/coolRE/tree/main/finite-automata)

## Why?
> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think
> "I know, I'll use regular expressions."   Now they have two problems.

Regulary expressions are interesting in their own right and a RE engine is not-too-hard-not-too-easy challenge.  

So why do this? For fun. 

Not to study how regex works, there's better ways to learn regex. 
But to learn, how to do more than just use regex.

Trying to build **the coolRE 3** - should be an interesting refresher in elementary Theory of Computation, Automata, Compilers.  


## What's in it for you?
As an engineer, I suspect you'd get the same value from coolRE as me.
Study the code or implement one of them on your own.
