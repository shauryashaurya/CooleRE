# CooleRE - toy implementation 01

A quick toy implementation following [Coding a regex engine from scratch with no imports in Python! from Clumsy Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgp0tKWYQWY)

This just recursively breaks an expression into tokens and matches them with the string.
Rudimentary but provides some insight into a brute force approach to Regex.
