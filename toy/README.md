# coolRE - toy implementation.

A regular expressions engine written in Python.
This variant uses a naive approach eventually.
It slowly builds up from a very simple string matching program, to a complex regex engine - all using brute force string manipulations.
Needless to say, many features of an actual regex engine are missing here.
